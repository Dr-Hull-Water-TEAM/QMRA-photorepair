# QMRA of Photorepair After UV Disinfection

# Attribution: This QMRA code for photorepair was developed by Daniel Ma with the advising of Dr. Mark H. Weir and Dr. Natalie M. Hull at The Ohio State University. This project was developed as a course project for PUBHES 7375 QMRA Modeling instructed by Dr. Mark H. Weir in Spring 2020 and incorporated into Daniel Ma's MS Thesis in Environmental Engineering at The Ohio State University.
